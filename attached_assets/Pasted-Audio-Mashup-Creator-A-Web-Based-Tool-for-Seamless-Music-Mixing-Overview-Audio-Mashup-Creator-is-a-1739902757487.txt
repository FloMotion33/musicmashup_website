Audio Mashup Creator: A Web-Based Tool for Seamless Music Mixing

Overview
Audio Mashup Creator is an innovative online platform that empowers users to transform their audio files into unique mashups with ease. The platform accepts a wide range of audio formats—including WAV, MP3, and many others—ensuring broad compatibility for all your music files. By leveraging advanced audio analysis and pre-built code for BPM extraction and audio merging, the tool simplifies the process of creating professional-sounding mashups.

Key Features

Multi-Format Audio Upload:
Users can drag-and-drop audio files in various formats (WAV, MP3, etc.), ensuring that no matter the source, your music is ready for analysis.
Automatic Audio Analysis:
BPM Detection:
Our integrated BPM extraction module (from your provided bpm_detection.py code) analyzes each track to determine its beats per minute, ensuring rhythmic consistency.
Key Identification:
The tool automatically identifies the musical key of each track, aiding in harmonic mixing for smoother transitions.
Stem Extraction:
Advanced AI algorithms isolate individual stems—such as vocals, instrumentals, and drums—making it effortless to mix and match elements from different songs.
Interactive Mashup Creation:
Audio Merging:
Using the pre-built merging functionality (from your music_merge.py code), users can effortlessly combine stems from multiple tracks. For instance, you can extract the vocals from one song and merge them with the instrumental of another.
BPM Adjustment:
Beyond extraction and merging, the platform lets users adjust the BPM of the final mix to ensure all elements are perfectly synchronized.
User-Friendly Interface:
An intuitive web interface supports drag-and-drop file uploads, real-time visual feedback (such as waveform displays), and straightforward controls for mixing and BPM adjustments.
Output and Sharing:
Preview your mashup directly on the platform, export the final audio in your preferred format, and share your creations seamlessly with friends or on social media.
Technical Implementation

Frontend:
Developed with modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React/Vue) for a responsive and engaging user experience.
Supports drag-and-drop uploads and real-time visualization of audio waveforms.
Backend:
Built with a robust server-side framework (such as Flask or Django in Python) to handle audio processing tasks efficiently.
Integrates your existing BPM extraction (bpm_detection.py) and audio merging (music_merge.py) scripts.
Utilizes libraries like FFmpeg or pydub to support various audio formats, ensuring seamless compatibility.
Deployment:
Hosted on scalable cloud platforms like Replit, the application is optimized for performance and reliability, even during intensive audio processing.
